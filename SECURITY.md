# Reporting security issues

To report security issues, use GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) forms such as https://github.com/lima-vm/lima/security/advisories/new .

If you do not have a GitHub account, you may use email to reach out to the [Committers](https://lima-vm.io/docs/community/governance/) directly.
See the GitHub profiles or the git commit logs to inspect the Committers' email addresses.

## Handling security issues
The [Committers](https://lima-vm.io/docs/community/governance/) will try to triage the report and make the first response within 7 days.
Releasing a fix may take a longer time, and may need further assistance from the reporter.

If you do not see any response after 7 days, ping the Committers via email or [Slack](https://lima-vm.io/docs/community/) privately.
